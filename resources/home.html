                <p>The PHP Community Conference is all about you! Come  on out to Nashville for a different kind of conference this spring.  We're going to hear from community members about projects they're  working on and how they were inspired. It's going to be a fun, laid-back event where you and the people you'll meet can collaborate to build some awesome applications of your own with PHP. Tickets go on sale February 3, 2011. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe to our mailing list</a>, and we'll keep you updated on all the latest PHP Community Conference news and information.</p>
                <p>Of course we'll need some help from all of you to pull this off. We're calling for presentations on the topic of  real world PHP. Tell us about an inspiring project you're working on  and why it's important. We don't want to focus on the details of the  code itself, but rather on how your project solves a problem or fills a  need. If selected as a speaker, we will cover your air fare and hotel  costs for the dates of the event. To submit a talk, please email your  proposed title and abstract to <a href="mailto:proposals@phpcon.org">proposals@phpcon.org</a> by January 31, 2011.</p>
