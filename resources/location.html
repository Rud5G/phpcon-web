                <p>We've booked a fantastic space for the first PHP Community Conference. During our search for a venue, <a href="http://www.nashvilleeventspace.com/venues/avenue/avenue-blank-venue/">aVenue</a> stood out because of its spacious, industrial feel, which we think suits our theme of building things out of big ideas. Located only a block away from the conference hotel, Hilton Nashville Downtown, aVenue is a relaxed, friendly space for our conference. aVenue is surounded by cool things to do in Downtown Nashville.
